# Task 1

In the solution presented here I assume that the data structure to be implemented is a binary tree.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three folders:

- `bin`: the folder with compiled output files
- `lib`: the folder conntaining .jar file from the JUnit testing framework
- `src`: the folder maintaining the source code, `App.java` file implements the solution, tests are in the `AppTest.java` file
